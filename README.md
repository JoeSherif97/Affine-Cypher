# Affine-Cypher
This was an implementation of a topic in a lab of Information, Storage and Management Course, the Topic was Affine Encryption and Decryption, so I simplify the method, and made a python code that take the input from the user in form of (Plain/Cypher Text, Two-part Encryption/Decryption Keys, the process choice) &amp; return the chosen operation output.
